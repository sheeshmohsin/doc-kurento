Kurento Tutorials
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section contains tutorials showing how to use Kurento framework to build
different types of `WebRTC`:term: and multimedia applications. Turorials come
in three flavors:

- **Java**: These show applications where clients interact with an application
  server based on Java EE technology. The application server hold the logic
  orchestrating the communication among the clients and controlling Kurento
  Server capabilities for them.

- **Browser JavaScript**: These show applications executing at the browser and
  communicating directly with the Kurento Media Server. In these tutorial, all
  the application logic is hold by the browser. Hence, no application server is
  necessary. For these reasons, these applications need to be simple.

- **Node.js**: These show applications where clients interact with an
  application server based on Node.js technology. The application server holds
  the logic orchestrating the communication among the clients and controlling
  Kurento Media Server capabilities for them.

.. note::

   These tutorials have been created with learning objectives. They are not
   intended to be used in production environments where different unmanaged error
   conditions may emerge.


Tutorial 1 - Hello world
========================

This is one of the simplest WebRTC application you can create with Kurento. It
implements a `WebRTC`:term: *loopback* (a WebRTC media stream going from client
to Kurento and back to the client)

Tutorial 2 - WebRTC magic mirror
================================

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
adding a funny hat over your face. This is an example of computer vision and
augmented reality using a filter.

Tutorial 3 - WebRTC one-to-many broadcast
=========================================

Video broadcasting for `WebRTC`:term:. One peer transmits a video stream and N
peers receives it.

Tutorial 4 - WebRTC one-to-one video call
=========================================

This web application is a videophone (call one to one) based on `WebRTC`:term:.

Tutorial 5 - WebRTC one-to-one video call with recording and filtering
======================================================================

This is an enhanced version of the previous application recording of the video
communication, and also integration with an augmented reality filter.
