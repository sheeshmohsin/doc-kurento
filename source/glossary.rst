This is a glossary of terms that often appear in discussion about multimedia
transmissions. Most of the terms are described and linked to its wikipedia, RFC
or W3C relevant documents. Some of the terms are specific to :term:`gstreamer`
or :term:`kurento`.


.. glossary::

    Agnostic, Media
        One of the big problems of media is that the number of variants
        of video and audio codecs, formats and variants quickly creates
        high complexity in heterogeneous applications. So kurento developed
        the concept of an automatic converter of media formats that enables
        development of *agnostic* elements. Whenever a media element’s
        source is connected to another media element’s sink, the kurento
        framework verifies if media adaption and transcoding is necessary
        and, if needed, it transparently incorporates the appropriate
        transformations making possible the chaining of the two elements
        into the resulting :term:`Pipeline <Media Pipeline>`.

    AVI
        Audio Video Interleaved, known by its initials AVI, is a multimedia
        container format introduced by Microsoft in November 1992 as part
        of its Video for Windows technology. AVI files can contain both
        audio and video data in a file container that allows synchronous
        audio-with-video playback. AVI is a derivative of the Resource
        Interchange File Format (RIFF).

    Bower
        `Bower <http://http://bower.io/>`_ is a package manager for the web.
        It offers a generic solution to the problem of front-end package management,
        while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by
        a build stack.

    Builder Pattern
        The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern whose 
        intention is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor 
        anti-pattern. The telescoping 
        constructor anti-pattern occurs when the increase of object constructor 
        parameter combination leads to an exponential list of constructors. 
        Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another 
        object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter step by 
        step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.

    CORS
        :wikipedia:`CORS <en,Cross-origin_resource_sharing>`
        is a mechanism that allows JavaScript code on a web page to make
        XMLHttpRequests to different domains than the one the
        JavaScript originated from. It works by adding new HTTP headers
        that allow servers to serve resources to permitted origin domains.
        Browsers support these headers and enforce the restrictions
        they establish.

        .. seealso::
            `enable-cors.org <http://enable-cors.org/>`__
                for information on the relevance of CORS and how and when

    Kurento
        `Kurento <http://kurento.org>`__ is a platform for the development of multimedia
        enabled applications. Kurento is the Esperanto term for the English word
        'stream'. We chose this name because we believe the Esperanto principles are
        inspiring for what the multimedia community needs: simplicity, openness and
        universality. Kurento is open source, released under LGPL 2.1, and has several
        components, providing solutions to most multimedia common services
        requirements. Those components include: term:`Kurento Media Server <Kurento Media Server>`,
        term:`Kurento API <Kurento API>`, term:`Kurento Protocol <Kurento Protocol>`, and
        term:`Kurento Client <Kurento Client>`.

    Kurento API
         **Kurento API** is an object oriented API to create media pipelines to control
         media. It can be seen as and interface to Kurento Media Server. It can be used from the
         Kurento Protocol or from Kurento Clients.

    Kurento Client
         A **Kurento Client** is a programming library (Java or JavaScript) used to control
         **Kurento Media Server** from an application. For example, with this library, any developer
         can create a web application that uses Kurento Media Server to receive audio and video from
         the user web browser, process it and send it back again over Internet. Kurento Client
         exposes the :term:`Kurento API <Kurento API>` to app developers.

    Kurento Protocol
         Communication between KMS and clients by means of :term:`JSON-RPC` messages.
         It is based on :term:`WebSocket` that uses :term:`JSON-RPC` V2.0 messages for making
         requests and sending responses.

    Kurento Media Server
         **Kurento Media Server** is the core element of Kurento since it responsible for media
         transmission, processing, loading and recording.

    Maven
        `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

    Media Element
        A :java:type:`MediaElement` is a module that encapsulates a specific
        media capability.  For example, a :java:type:`RecorderEndpoint`,
        a Video :java:type:`PlayerEndpoint`

    Media Pipeline
        A :index:`Media Pipeline <single: Media; Pipeline>` is a chain of media elements, where the output
        stream generated by one element (source) is fed into one or
        more other elements input streams (sinks). Hence, the pipeline
        represents a “machine” capable of performing a sequence of
        operations over a stream.

    Media Plane
        In the traditional :wikipedia:`3GPP Mobile Carrier Media Framework
        <en,IP_Multimedia_Subsystem>`, the handling of media is conceptually
        splitted in two layers.
        The one that handles the media itself, with functionalities such as
        media transport, encoding/decoding, and processing, is called
        :index:`Media Plane <single: Plane; Media>`.

        .. seealso:: :term:`Signaling Plane`

    MP4
        MPEG-4 Part 14 or MP4 is a digital multimedia format most commonly
        used to store video and audio, but can also be used to store other
        data such as subtitles and still images.

        .. seealso:: Wikipedia definition of :wikipedia:`MP4
                     <en,MPEG-4_Part_14>`.

    Multimedia
        Multimedia is concerned with the computer controlled integration
        of text, graphics, video, animation, audio, and any other media where
        information can be represented, stored, transmitted and processed
        digitally.

        There is a temporal relationship between many forms of media,
        for instance audio, video and animations. There 2 are forms of problems
        involved in

            * Sequencing within the media, i.e. playing frames in correct
              order or time frame.
            * Synchronisation, i.e. inter-media scheduling. For example,
              keeping video and audio synchronized or displaying captions
              or subtitles in the required intervals.

        .. seealso:: Wikipedia definition of :wikipedia:`en,Multimedia`

    Multimedia container format
        Container or wrapper formats are metafile formats whose
        specification describes how different data elements and metadata
        coexist in a computer file.

        Simpler multimedia container formats can contain different types
        of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can
        support multiple audio and video streams, subtitles,
        chapter-information, and meta-data, along with the synchronization
        information needed to play back the various streams together.
        In most cases, the file header, most of the  metadata and the
        synchro chunks are specified by the container format.
