Node.js Module Tutorial 3 - Crowd Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a crowd detector filter. This filter detects people
agglomeration in video streams.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide <../../installation_guide>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-crowddetector`` should be
also installed:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    sudo apt-get install kms-crowddetector

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: and `Bower`:term: in your system. In
an Ubuntu machine, you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

To launch the application you need to clone the GitHub project where this demo
is hosted and then install and run it, as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-node/kurento-crowddetector
    npm install

Finally access the application connecting to the URL http://localhost:8080/
through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a crowd in a WebRTC stream.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with crowdDetector filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-crowddetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-1-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **CrowdDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

To setup a ``CrowdDetectorFilter``, first we need to define one or more
*region of interests* (ROIs). A ROI delimits the zone within the video stream
in which crowd are going to be tracked. To define a ROI, we need to configure
at least three points. These points are defined in relative terms (0 to 1) to
the video width and height.

``CrowdDetectorFilter`` performs two actions in the defined ROIs. On the one
hand, the detected crowd are colored over the stream. On the other hand,
different events are raised to the client.

To understand crowd coloring, we can take a look to an screenshot of a running
example of ``CrowdDetectorFilter``. In the picture below, we can see that there
are two ROIs (bounded with white lines in the video). On these ROIs, we can see
two different colors over the original video stream: red zones are drawn over
detected static crowds (or moving slowly). Blue zones are drawn over the
detected crowds moving fast.

   *Crowd detection sample*

Regarding crowd events, there are three types of events, namely:

* CrowdDetectorFluidityEvent. Event raised when a certain level of fluidity is
  detected in a ROI. Fluidity can be seen as the level of general movement in a
  crowd.

* CrowdDetectorOccupancyEvent. Event raised when a level of occupancy is
  detected in a ROI. Occupancy can be seen as the level of agglomeration in
  stream.

* CrowdDetectorDirectionEvent. Event raised when a movement direction is
  detected in a ROI by a crowd.

Both fluidity as occupancy are quantified in a relative metric from 0 to 100%.
Then, both attributes are qualified into three categories: i) Minimum (min);
ii) Medium (med); iii) Maximum (max).

Regarding direction, it is quantified as an angle (0-360º), where 0 is the
direction from the central point of the video to the top (i.e., north), 90
correspond to the direction to the right (east), 180 is the south, and finally
270 is the west.

With all these concepts, now we can check out the Java server-side code of this
demo. As depicted in the snippet below, we create a ROI by adding
``RelativePoint`` instances to a list. Each ROI is then stored into a list of
``RegionOfInterest`` instances.

Then, each ROI should be configured. To do that, we have the following methods:

 * ``fluidityLevelMin``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *minimum*.
 * ``fluidityLevelMed``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *medium*.
 * ``fluidityLevelMax``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *maximum*.
 * ``fluidityNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   fluidity level to rise a  event.
 * ``occupancyLevelMin``:  Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category
   *minimum*.
 * ``occupancyLevelMed``: Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category *medium*.
 * ``occupancyLevelMax``: Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category *maximum*.
 * ``occupancyNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   occupancy level to rise a event.
 * ``sendOpticalFlowEvent``: Boolean value that indicates whether or not
   directions events are going to be tracked by the filter. Be careful with
   this feature, since it is very demanding in terms of resource usage (CPU,
   memory) in the media server. Set to true this parameter only when you are
   going to need directions events in your client-side.
 * ``opticalFlowNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   direction level to rise a event.
 * ``opticalFlowNumFramesToReset``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   occupancy level in which the counter is reset.
 * ``opticalFlowAngleOffset``: Counterclockwise offset of the angle. This
   parameters is useful to move the default axis for directions (0º=north,
   90º=east, 180º=south, 270º=west).

All in all, the media pipeline of this demo is is implemented as follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   function start(sessionId, sdpOffer, callback) {
   
      if (!sessionId) {
         return callback("Cannot use undefined sessionId");
      }
   
      // Check if session is already transmitting
      if (pipelines[sessionId]) {
         return callback("Close current session before starting a new one or use " +
            "another browser to open a tutorial.")
      }
   
      getKurentoClient(function(error, kurentoClient) {
         if (error) {
            return callback(error);
         }
   
         kurentoClient.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, pipeline) {
            if (error) {
               return callback(error);
            }
   
            createMediaElements(pipeline, function(error, webRtcEndpoint,
                  crowdDetector) {

                  pipeline.release();
                  return callback(error);
               }
   
               connectMediaElements(webRtcEndpoint, crowdDetector,
                  function(error) {
                     if (error) {
                        pipeline.release();
                        return callback(error);
                     }
   
                     crowdDetector.on ('CrowdDetectorDirection', function (_data){
                        return callback(null, 'crowdDetectorDirection', _data);

                     });
   
                     webRtcEndpoint.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(
                           error, sdpAnswer) {

Dependencies
============

Dependencies of this demo are managed using NPM. Our main dependency is the
Kurento Client JavaScript (*kurento-client*). The relevant part of the
`package.json <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/master/kurento-crowddetector/package.json>`_
file for managing this dependency is:

.. sourcecode:: js

   "dependencies": {
      "kurento-client": "^5.0.0",
   }

At the client side, dependencies are managed using Bower. Take a look to the
`bower.json <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/master/kurento-crowddetector/static/bower.json>`_
file and pay attention to the following section:

.. sourcecode:: js

   "dependencies": {
      "kurento-utils": "^5.0.0",
      "kurento-module-crowddetector": "^1.0.0"
   }

Kurento framework uses `Semantic Versioning`:term: for releases. Notice that
ranges (``^5.0.0`` for *kurento-client* and *kurento-utils-js*,  and ``^1.0.0``
for *crowddetector*) downloads the latest version of Kurento artifacts from NPM
and Bower.
