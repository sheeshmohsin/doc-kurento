Node.js Tutorial 1 - Hello world
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application has been designed to introduce the principles of
programming with Kurento for Node.js developers. It consists on a
`WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror (*loopback*). This tutorial
assumes you have basic knowledge on JavaScript, Node.js, HTML and WebRTC. We
also recommend reading the
:doc:`Introducing Kurento <../../introducing_kurento>` section before starting
this tutorial.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

You need to have installed the Kurento Media Server before running this example.
Read the :doc:`installation guide <../../installation_guide>` for further
information.

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: in your system. In an Ubuntu machine,
you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

To launch the application you need to clone the GitHub project where this demo
is hosted and then install and run it, as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-node/kurento-hello-world
    npm install
    npm start

If you have problems installing any of the dependencies, please remove them and
clean the npm cache, and try to install them again:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    rm -r node_modules
    npm cache clean

Access the application connecting to the URL http://localhost:8080/ through a
WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).


Understanding this example
==========================

Kurento provides developers a **Kurento JavaScript Client** to control
**Kurento Media Server**. This client library can be used from compatible
JavaScript engines including browsers and Node.js.

This *hello world* demo is one of the simplest web application you can create
with Kurento. The following picture shows an screenshot of this demo running:

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one showing the local stream (as captured by the device webcam) and
the other showing the remote stream sent by the media server back to the client.

The logic of the application is quite simple: the local stream is sent to the
Kurento Media Server, which returns it back to the client without
modifications. To implement this behavior we need to create a
`Media Pipeline`:term: composed by a single `Media Element`:term:, i.e. a
**WebRtcEndpoint**, which holds the capability of exchanging full-duplex
(bidirectional) WebRTC media flows. This media element is connected to itself
so that the media it receives (from browser) is send back (to browser). This
media pipeline is illustrated in the following picture:

   *Kurento Hello World Media Pipeline in context*

This is a web application, and therefore it follows a client-server
architecture. At the client-side, the logic is implemented in **JavaScript**.
At the server-side we use a Node.js application server consuming the
**Kurento JavaScript Client** API to control **Kurento Media Server**
capabilities. All in all, the high level architecture of this demo is
three-tier. To communicate these entities the following technologies are used:

* `REST`:term:: Communication between JavaScript client-side and Node.js
  application server-side.

* `WebSocket`:term:: Communication between the Kurento JavaScript Client and
  the Kurento Media Server. This communication is implemented by the
  **Kurento Protocol**. For further information, please see this
  :doc:`page <../../mastering/kurento_protocol>` of the documentation.

The diagram below shows an complete sequence diagram from the interactions with
the application interface to: i) JavaScript logic; ii) Application server logic
(which uses the Kurento JavaScript Client); iii) Kurento Media Server.

.. note::

   The communication between client and server-side does not need to be
   REST. For simplicity, in this tutorial REST has been used. In later examples
   a more complex signaling between client and server has been implement,
   using WebSockets. Please see later tutorials for further information.

The following sections analyze in deep the server and client-side code of this
application. The complete source code can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/tree/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world>`_.


Application Server Logic
========================

This demo has been developed using the **express** framework for Node.js, but
express is not a requirement for Kurento.

The main script of this demo is
`server.js <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world/server.js>`_.
As you can see, the *KurentoClient* is instantiated in this class. In this
instantiation we see that we need to specify to the client library the location
of the Kurento Media Server. In this example, we assume it's located at
*localhost* listening in port 8888. If you reproduce this example you'll need
to insert the specific location of your Kurento Media Server instance there.

Once the *Kurento Client* has been instantiated, you are ready for communicating
with Kurento Media Server and controlling its multimedia capabilities. Our
first operation is to create a *Media Pipeline*.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var kurento = require('kurento-client');

   //...

   const ws_uri = "ws://localhost:8888/kurento";

   //...

   kurento(ws_uri, function(error, kurentoClient) {
	   if (error) {
		   return callback(error);
	   }
	   kurentoClient.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
		   if (error) {
			   return callback(error);
		   }
		   pipeline = _pipeline;
		   return callback(null, pipeline);
	   });
   });

As introduced before, we use `REST`:term: to communicate the client with the
Node.js application server:

.. sourcecode:: js

   app.post('/helloworld', function(req, res) {
      var sdpOffer = req.body;
      getPipeline(function(error, pipeline) {
         pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtcEndpoint) {
            webRtcEndpoint.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
               webRtcEndpoint.connect(webRtcEndpoint, function(error) {
                  res.type('application/sdp');
                  res.send(sdpAnswer);
               });
            });
         });
      });
   });

As it can be observed, when a  POST requests arrives to path */helloworld*, we
execute a logic comprising two steps:

 - **Configure media processing logic**: This is the part in which the
   application configures how Kurento has to process the media. In other words,
   the media pipeline is recovered and, using it, the media elements we need
   are created and connected. In this case, we only instantiate one
   *WebRtcEndpoint* for receiving the WebRTC stream and sending it back to the
   client.

 - **WebRTC SDP negotiation**: In WebRTC, an `SDP`:term: (Session Description
   protocol) is used for negotiating media exchanges between apps. Such
   negotiation happens based on the SDP offer and answer exchange mechanism. In
   this example we assume the SDP offer and answer contain all WebRTC ICE
   candidates. This negotiation takes place when invoking *processOffer*, using
   the SDP offer obtained from the browser client and returning a SDP answer
   generated by WebRtcEndpoint.


Client-Side Logic
=================

Let's move now to the client-side of the application, which follows
*Single Page Application* architecture (`SPA`:term:). To call the previously
created REST service, we use the JavaScript library `jQuery`:term:. In
addition, we use a Kurento JavaScript utilities library called
**kurento-utils.js** to simplify the WebRTC management in the browser. This
library depends on **adapter.js**, which is a JavaScript WebRTC utility
maintained by Google that abstracts away browser differences. Finally
**jquery.js** is also needed in this application.

These libraries are linked in the
`index.html <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world/static/index.html>`_
web page, and are used in the
`index.js <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world/static/js/index.js>`_.
In the *start* function we can see how jQuery is used to send a POST request to
the path */helloworld*, where the application server REST service is listening.
The function *WebRtcPeer.startSendRecv* abstracts the WebRTC internal details
(i.e. PeerConnection and getUserStream) and makes possible to start a
full-duplex WebRTC communication, using the HTML video tag with id *videoInput*
to show the video camera (local stream) and the video tag *videoOutput* to show
the remote stream provided by the Kurento Media Server.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   var webRtcPeer;

   function start() {
      console.log("Starting video call ...");
      showSpinner(videoInput, videoOutput);
      webRtcPeer =
         kurentoUtils.WebRtcPeer.startSendRecv(videoInput, videoOutput, onOffer, onError);
   }

   function onOffer(sdpOffer) {
      console.info('Invoking SDP offer callback function ' + location.host);
      $.ajax({
         url : location.protocol + '/helloworld',
         type : 'POST',
         dataType : 'text',
         contentType : 'application/sdp',
         data : sdpOffer,
         success : function(sdpAnswer) {
            console.log("Received sdpAnswer from server. Processing ...");
            webRtcPeer.processSdpAnswer(sdpAnswer);
         },
         error : function(jqXHR, textStatus, error) {
            onError(error);
         }
      });
   }

   function onError(error) {
      console.error(error);
   }


Dependencies
============

Dependencies of this demo are managed using npm. Our main dependency is the
Kurento Client JavaScript (*kurento-client*). The relevant part of the
`package.json <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world/package.json>`_
file for managing this dependency is:

.. sourcecode:: js

   "dependencies": {
      ...
      "kurento-client" : "^5.0.0"
   }

At the client side, dependencies are managed using Bower. Take a look to the
`bower.json <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/release-5.1/kurento-hello-world/static/bower.json>`_
file and pay attention to the following section:

.. sourcecode:: js

   "dependencies": {
      "kurento-utils" : "^5.0.0"
   }

Kurento framework uses `Semantic Versioning`:term: for releases. Notice that
range ``^5.0.0`` downloads the latest version of Kurento artefacts from Bower
in version 5 (i.e. 5.x.x). Major versions are released when incompatible
changes are made.

.. note::

   We are in active development. You can find the latest version of
   Kurento JavaScript Client at `NPM <http://npmsearch.com/?q=kurento-client>`_
   and `Bower <http://bower.io/search/?q=kurento-client>`_.
