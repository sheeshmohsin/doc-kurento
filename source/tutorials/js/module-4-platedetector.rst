JavaScript Module Tutorial 4 - Plate Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a plate detector filter element.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide <../../installation_guide>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-platedetector`` should be
also installed. Kurento Media Server should be restarted in order to load the
new plugin:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    sudo apt-get install kms-platedetector
    sudo service kurento-media-server restart

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: and `Bower`:term: in your system. In
an Ubuntu machine, you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

Due to `Same-origin policy`:term:, this demo has to be served by an HTTP server.
A very simple way of doing this is by means of a HTTP Node.js server which can
be installed using `npm`:term: :

.. sourcecode:: sh

   sudo npm install http-server -g

You also need the source code of this demo. You can clone it from GitHub. Then
start the HTTP server:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-platedetector
    bower install
    http-server

Finally access the application connecting to the URL http://localhost:8080/
through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a plate in a WebRTC stream on optical character recognition (OCR).

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with plateDetector filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-platedetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-1-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **PlateDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter. An screenshot
of the running example is shown in the following picture:

   *Plate detector demo in action*

The following snippet shows how the media pipeline is implemented in the Java
server-side code of the demo. An important issue in this code is that a
listener is added to the ``PlateDetectorFilter`` object
(``addPlateDetectedListener``). This way, each time a plate is detected in the
stream, a message is sent to the client side. As shown in the screenshot below,
this event is printed in the console of the GUI.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   kurentoClient(ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, p) {
         if (error) return onError(error);

         pipeline = p;

         pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            pipeline.create('PlateDetectorFilter', function(error, filter) {
               if (error) return onError(error);
               
               webRtc.connect(filter, function(error) {
                  if (error) return onError(error);

                  filter.connect(webRtc, function(error) {
                     if (error) return onError(error);

                     filter.on ('PlateDetected', function (data){
                        console.log ("License plate detected " + data.plate);
                     });
                  });
               });

               webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
                  if (error) return onError(error);

                  webRtcPeer.processSdpAnswer(sdpAnswer);
               });
            });
         });
      });
   });


Dependencies
============

The dependencies of this demo has to be obtained using `Bower`:term:. The
definition of these dependencies are defined in the
`bower.json <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js/blob/release-5.1/kurento-platedetector/bower.json>`_
file, as follows:

.. sourcecode:: js

   "dependencies": {
      "kurento-client": "^5.0.0",
      "kurento-utils": "^5.0.0",
      "kurento-module-platedetector": "^1.0.0"
   }

Kurento framework uses `Semantic Versioning`:term: for releases. Notice that
ranges (``^5.0.0`` for *kurento-client* and *kurento-utils-js*,  and ``^1.0.0``
for *platedetector*) downloads the latest version of Kurento artifacts from
Bower.
