Java Module Tutorial 2 - Chroma Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a chroma filter element.


For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide <../../installation_guide>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-chroma`` should be also
installed. Kurento Media Server should be restarted in order to load the new
plugin:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    sudo apt-get install kms-chroma
    sudo service kurento-media-server restart

Moreover, `JDK`:term: (at least version 7), `Maven`:term:, `Git`:term:, and
`Bower`:term: should be installed in your system. Bower is installed using
`npm`:term: (`Node.js`:term: package manager). In an Ubuntu machine it can be
done as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

To launch the application you need to clone the GitHub project where this demo
is hosted and then run the main class, as follows:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-java/kurento-chroma
    mvn clean compile exec:java

The web application starts on port 8080 in the localhost by default. Therefore,
open the URL http://localhost:8080/ in a WebRTC compliant browser (Chrome,
Firefox).

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a chroma in a WebRTC stream based on color tracking.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-chroma-pipeline.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     WebRTC with Chroma filter Media Pipeline

   *WebRTC with Chroma filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-chroma>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-1-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **Chroma** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

In order to perform chroma detection, there must be a color calibration stage.
To accomplish this step, at the beginning of the demo, a little square appears
in upper left of the video, as follows:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-chroma-screenshot-01.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     Chroma calibration stage

   *Chroma calibration stage*

In the first second of the demo, a calibration process is done, by detecting the
color inside that square. When the calibration is finished, the square
disappears and the chroma is substituted with the configured image. Take into
account that this process requires lighting condition. Otherwise the chroma
substitution will not be perfect. This behavior can be seen in the upper right
corner of the following screenshot:

The media pipeline of this demo is is implemented in the server-side logic as
follows:

.. sourcecode:: java

   private void start(WebSocketSession session, JsonObject jsonMessage) {
      try {
         // Media Logic (Media Pipeline and Elements)
         MediaPipeline pipeline = kurento.createMediaPipeline();
         pipelines.put(session.getId(), pipeline);

         WebRtcEndpoint webRtcEndpoint = new WebRtcEndpoint.Builder(pipeline)
               .build();
         ChromaFilter chromaFilter = new ChromaFilter.Builder(pipeline,
               new WindowParam(5, 5, 40, 40)).build();

         String appServerUrl = System.getProperty("app.server.url",
               ChromaApp.DEFAULT_APP_SERVER_URL);
         chromaFilter.setBackground(appServerUrl + "/img/mario.jpg");

         webRtcEndpoint.connect(chromaFilter);
         chromaFilter.connect(webRtcEndpoint);

         // SDP negotiation (offer and answer)
         String sdpOffer = jsonMessage.get("sdpOffer").getAsString();
         String sdpAnswer = webRtcEndpoint.processOffer(sdpOffer);

         // Sending response back to client
         JsonObject response = new JsonObject();
         response.addProperty("id", "startResponse");
         response.addProperty("sdpAnswer", sdpAnswer);
         session.sendMessage(new TextMessage(response.toString()));
      } catch (Throwable t) {
         sendError(session, t.getMessage());
      }
   }


Dependencies
============

This Java Spring application is implemented using `Maven`:term:. The relevant
part of the *pom.xml* is where Kurento dependencies are declared. As the
following snippet shows, we need three dependencies: the Kurento Client Java
dependency (*kurento-client*), the JavaScript Kurento utility library
(*kurento-utils*) for the client-side, and the chroma module (*chroma*):

.. sourcecode:: xml 

   <dependencies> 
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.kurento</groupId>
         <artifactId>kurento-client</artifactId>
         <version>[5.0.0,6.0.0)</version>
      </dependency> 
      <dependency> 
         <groupId>org.kurento</groupId>
         <artifactId>kurento-utils-js</artifactId> 
         <version>[5.0.0,6.0.0)</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.kurento.module</groupId>
         <artifactId>chroma</artifactId>
         <version>[1.0.0,2.0.0)</version>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>

Kurento framework uses `Semantic Versioning`:term: for releases. Notice that
ranges (``[5.0.0,6.0.0)`` for *kurento-client* and *kurento-utils-js*,  and
``[1.0.0,2.0.0)`` for *chroma*) downloads the latest version of Kurento
artifacts from Maven Central.
